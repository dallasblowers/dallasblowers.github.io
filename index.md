## Project Overview

Augmented Apprentice is a personal project where I want to pursue my long-buried interest in learning about the design and fabrication of physical objects. In a world increasingly digitized, I want to find a way to merry the benefits of technology I gleefully play with and traditionally crafted items which I admire. The focus of the project is to learn how to use technology to enhance my creative output and technical skill. In pursuing this hybrid model of traditional and digital, I hope to become a more well-rounded person. I also believe the "divide" between physical and digital projects are largely arbitrary and am fasinated by opportunities to explore their intersection.

As of January 1, 2024, my fabrication and design skills are limited and not where I'd like them to be. I've decided I want to learn new skills in a series of sprints, inspired by projects such as "The First 20 Hours" and Mike Boyd's learn quick. My hope is that by doing so, I can overcome the initial fear and quickly add to my toolbelt (pun only slightly intended.)

The mediums I intend to explore include:
- Traditional pencil/pen and paper
- Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and Extended Reality
- Plastic and Resin Based Prints (3d printing)
- Computer Design (CAD and voxel-based modeling like Blender)
- Code, especially Python and some C as required
- Dremel and Wood
- Fabric

By the end of this project (tentatively a 3-year experiment) I hope I will have dramatically improved my skills in the following areas:
- Rapid Skill Acquisition
- Technologically Augmented Creativity
- Product Design and Construction
- Communication and Execution

I plan on regularly updating this site and the email newsletter. As my skills improve and I learn to make more interesting objects, I also hope to regularly release build plans/instructions with bills of materials. Thanks for reading this far and I'm excited to have you along for the journey.
