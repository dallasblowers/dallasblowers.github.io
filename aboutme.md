subtitle: So who is this guy!?

My name is Dallas. I'm a nerd at heart and have always been trying to find a way to "get out in the real world" and create more while staying close to my love of technology. By day, I'm a data analyst at a healthcare company, but at night, I'm an artist and maker. I hope you find this documentation of my journey useful as I learn more about:

- Machine Learning
- AI (Specifically focused on ML listed above, as well as Neural Networks and Language Models)
- Blockchain
- Extended Reality (XR)
- Woodworking
- Fabric Crafts
- Upcycling
- Pencil and Pen Artwork
- Product Design
- 3D Modeling and Printing

## My Dream
I hope to develop the skills to be able to outline and at least prototype any idea that comes into my mind. Admittedly, a lot of my artistic interests have lately been at the intersection between the physical and digital world. I've always wanted to have the ability to mesh the two seemingly seperate realms into one.
