# Project Ideas Tracker

Welcome to my project ideas tracker! Here, I'm sharing the various ideas that cross my mind and their respective stages of development. Some are silly, some useful, all various levels of wonky, although unfortunatley I don't have a chocolate factory. 

## Shower Thoughts

- **Operation Paper Pal:**
  - Love him or hate him, you've almost certainly heard of clippy. During his run, he unfairly was hated due to trying to be a little too helpful. I think it'd be fun to bring him back in a physical form but update the software for a more helpful companion. 

- **Crafty Companions Connect:**
  - Wanting to create a more centralized directory of makers. Initially, the goal would be to create a quick directory where you can search for makers by name, project types, or preferred media. Eventually, the hope would be to scale to add a recommendation system and some automation to automagically update the directory.

- **SkillSculpt Navigator:**
  - There are so many great projects online, but sometimes (especially as a beginner) estimating difficulty or cost can be difficult. This utiliy would be designed to help give a better feel for that.

- **Snowbot:**
  - I recently saw a video of a lego snowblower and have previously seen videos of 3d printed mini lawnmowers. I was wondering if I could channel the same energy into a snowplowing/throwing version. 

- **Recreate a childhood lab like Jimmy Neutron or Dexter's Lab:**
  - Admittedly, this is a pipe dream, but the concept is just so fun. It'd be cool to someday be able to purchase some land, get all the permits etc. and make an homage to these childhood inspirations.

- **Bookmark Buddy:**
  - As I was reading a library book I realized I would like to give new life to an old friend - the bookmark. I think it would be fantastic to have a bookmark that has a lense and memorychip built-in, so I can keep an analoge reading experience, but still have the ability to "save" impactful sections for later writing, thought, or dialogue.

- **A More Perfect Pitch:**
  - I love singing for fun and would like to improve, but currently can't justify singing lessons. I wonder if it'd be possible to have a version of a vocal coach using AI and popular music. The idea would be to collect songs I like, and map the pitch, timing etc, then record my own voice and have the AI attempt to see how well I "match" the rendition.
 
- **Silent Soliloquy:**
  - I recently saw these masks that are suppose to allow singers to warm up without distrubing those around them. I wonder if the idea could be modified slightly to include a microphone so that you could "soliloquy" your thoughts without driving those around you (or neighbors) mad. 

## Being Researched

- **Codex of Creativity:**
  - Otherwise known as a home server. I have so much media I would like to centralize in one place. It would be the home of my obsidian setup in addition to storage for ebooks, audiobooks, podcasts, online courses, and raw project notes.

- **StatSavant:**
  - I'm curious if I can make a minimum viable version of an AI-tutor for the introductory statistics course I teach each semester. I see Harvard CS50 has launched a version of this and I'm curious if I can build on the growing number of librarys and Github projects.

## In Development

- **This Website:**
  - Perhaps this is a bit of a cheat; however, this was the first project to get me use to creating minimum viable products and using an assistive AI tool to help me reduce the research space into an actionable win. More detailed post of my process will be posted soon.

- **The Newsletter:**
  - Finishing up some additional research and locking in the format; however I would like to start sending out a bi-weekly issue that's an aggregation of a few inspiring projects, tools, or techniques I found between issues. 

- **Personal Scoreboard:**
  - I grew up playing video games, and while I don't play as often as I like, I'd like to try to apply the principle of gamification to my life. Treating myself almost like a Tamagotchi, I'd like to see if I could maximize my self-care score.
